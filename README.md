computer vision and ml experiment

#pytorch #pytorch_lightning #wandb

the tasks to complete are:

    1. (Data Preprocessing): The student should preprocess the images by resizing them to a common size, converting them to grayscale or RGB, and normalizing the pixel values.
    2. [OPTION #1] Feature Extraction using SIFT and Bag of Words: The student should extract features from the images
    using Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) (or similar approaches) and Bag of Words (BoW) representation and train a
    traditional classifier (e.g., Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Random Forests, or k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)) to classify
    them.
    3. Convolutional Neural Networks: The student should train a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the preprocessed
    images to classify them into different categories. The student should experiment with a custom neural architecture.
    4. [OPTION #2] The students have to cast the problem as supervised learning and self-supervised learning.
    5. Model Evaluation: The student should evaluate the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy,
    precision, recall, and F1-score.
    6. Hyperparameter Tuning: The student should fine-tune the hyperparameters of the models to achieve better
    performance.
