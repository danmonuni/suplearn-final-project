# Supervised Learning Final Project

University project on supervised learning. The project consists of a computer vision and ml experiment on a noisy and fine grained dataset (https://github.com/karansikka1/iFood_2019).

The tasks to complete are:

    1. (Data Preprocessing): The student should preprocess the images by resizing them to a common size, converting them to grayscale or RGB, and normalizing the pixel values.
    2. Feature Extraction using SIFT and Bag of Words: The student should extract features from the images using Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) (or similar approaches) and Bag of Words (BoW) representation and train a traditional classifier (e.g., Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Random Forests, or k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)) to classify them.
    3. Convolutional Neural Networks: The student should train a convolutional neural network (CNN < 1M parameters) on the preprocessed images to classify them into different categories. The student should experiment with a custom neural architecture.
    5. Model Evaluation: The student should evaluate the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
    6. Hyperparameter Tuning: The student should fine-tune the hyperparameters of the models to achieve better performance.
